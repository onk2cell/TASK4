# Chatbot with OpenAI's GPT-3 using Streamlit

This is a Python script that creates a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 model with Streamlit as the user interface. The chatbot can answer questions and provide responses based on a conversation history and a pre-trained language model. It can also extract text from PDF files and use them for conversation.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and use the chatbot.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following dependencies installed:

- `streamlit`
- `PyPDF2`
- `decouple`
- `langchain`
- `scikit-learn`

You will also need an API key from OpenAI, which you should set as the `api_key` in the script.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit PyPDF2 python-decouple langchain scikit-learn
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:

   Open the script and replace `api_key` with your actual API key.

### Usage

To run the chatbot, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your script.

## Features

- Upload a PDF file for text extraction.
- Use OpenAI's GPT-3 model to answer questions and generate responses.
- Maintain a conversation history and allow for multiple sessions.
- Preview and clear the memory store and buffer.
- Choose from different GPT-3 models and specify the number of prompts to consider.

# How It Works

This chatbot leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model for natural language understanding and generation. It also uses the Streamlit framework to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot. Here's a breakdown of how the chatbot works:

1. **Setup and Dependencies**: The chatbot requires several Python libraries, including Streamlit, PyPDF2, decouple, langchain, and scikit-learn. You'll also need an API key from OpenAI, which should be set in the script.

2. **PDF Text Extraction**: If a PDF file is uploaded, the chatbot uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from the PDF. The extracted text is then divided into smaller chunks for indexing.

3. **OpenAI Integration**: The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide responses to user input. The selected GPT-3 model can be configured, and the number of prompts to consider is adjustable.

4. **Conversation History**: The chatbot maintains a conversation history, allowing for multi-turn interactions. Each user input and bot response is stored in the session state for reference.

5. **Memory Store and Buffer**: Users can preview and clear the memory store and buffer, which are parts of the chatbot's internal architecture for managing conversations.

6. **Multiple Sessions**: The chatbot supports multiple sessions, allowing users to save and access previous conversation sessions.

7. **User Interface**: Streamlit is used to create a user interface where users can enter text, receive responses, and manage the chatbot's memory store and buffer.

8. **User Instructions**: The README provides instructions on how to install and run the chatbot.

9. **Contributions**: If you'd like to contribute to the project, there are guidelines for forking and creating pull requests in the README.

10. **License**: The project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, with details provided in the README.

This section outlines the key components and functionality of the chatbot, helping users understand how to use it effectively and how it processes and responds to user input.
